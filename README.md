# Overview
This repo contains code for the course "Time Series Econometrics for Finance".

To be able to run this code, you will need to download some helper functions that are used. These are available from:
https://github.com/4db83/db.toolbox/archive/refs/heads/main.zip.
Simply download the .zip file by clicking on the above link, or if you are using git, clone them to your local directory.

In Matlab you then have the following choices to integrate the db.toolbox:
1) Add permanently: in Matlab, go to Home -> Set Path. Then click on "add with subfolders" and locate the "db.toolbox-main" directory that you just downloaded and have unzipped.
2) Add temporally: simply uncomment line number 5: `% addpath(genpath('./db.toolbox-main'))` from the respective script that is run.
